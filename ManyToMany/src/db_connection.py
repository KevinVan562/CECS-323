To get getpass to work properly in PyCharm, you need to configure your project:
Click on the Run Menu at the very top of your PyCharm window.
Select the Edit Configurations menu item.
Select the "Emulate terminal in output console" checkbox.
This will allow getpass to display the prompt and receive your password in the console.

# This is the URL to my local PostgresSql database.
"""The breakdown of the fields in the URL and what they signify follows:
postgresql -        The relational database dialect.  Note that 'postgres' is no longer 
                    supported by sqlalchemy as a name for this dialect.
psycopg2 -          The database API employed.  It turns out that the default is psycopg2,
                    but I prefer to be explicit.  One less chance of failure.
userID:password     The user credentials used for logging into the database.
host                The name of the "machine" where PostgreSQL is running.
                    "localhost" signifies that the PostgreSQL instance is running on the
                    same machine where the application is running.
port                The default port # for PostgreSQL is 5432, but I already had a
                    database using that port, so that's why it defaults to 5433.
database            The name of the database within this particular instance of 
                    PostgreSQL.  Every PostgreSQL has a postgres database, but
                    you can create additional databases as needed.  Each CECS 323
                    section has their own database in the campus PostgreSQL instance."""
